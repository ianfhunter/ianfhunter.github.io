This is not its final incarnationObsidianObsidian is a self-described knowledge-base of local knowledge - but it’s essentially an IDE for Markdown files with a few extra bells and whistles.In my previous article, I wrote about how I find a bullet journal really useful for allowing unstructured thoughts to be stored in a single place, without the implicit pressure of compliance to the form of regularly structured notepad pages.Obsidian scratches the same itch. I can develop my notes and knowledgebase as much (or as little) as I want. And it’s freeing.Daily NotesOne of the core features they provide is recurring Daily Notes. This has been invaluable for keeping track of my active tasks for work.In the past, I had a desk calendar, with a small space for each day during the week - which would inevitably overflow into other pages. It was a great quick reference to get started in the morning - and possibly more importantly - to allow my brain to shut off once work was done.There are also Weekly and Monthly variants, but I find these work better offline for getting my mind straight about particularly hectic weeks.Other Built-In FeaturesOther really useful features I’ve found have been: The ability to Present your notes - I don’t have to power up the beefy PowerPoint to illustrate a simple idea. Mermaid support, for quick reference diagrams.Premium FeaturesObisidan offers a few premium features - Sync and Publish being the main two.However, with Obsidian’s community plugins, it’s reasonably straightforward to connect your files with git and have a backup system across multiple devices.YAFPA (“Yet Another Free Publish Alternative”) has also allowed me to publish select notes to the web. You’re probably reading this on this solution right now! This wasn’t quite as straightforward, but with a combination of GitHub Actions and Github pages, I have it working autonomously. When I write something publishable in my notes, it’ll be online within the next few minutes.The main thing I’m missing is the Mobile app. And I may be able to solve this at some point (for having it on the go would be very handy), but for now, it’s not super vital to me.(TODO: sequence diagram of auto-publishing)ReplacementSo let’s have a look at what I’ve replaced by using obsidian:graph TDO[\"Obsidian\"]A1[\"Paper Notebooks\"]A2[\"Desk Calendar\"]A3[\"OneNote\"]A4[\"Notion\"]A5[\"TiddlyWiki\"]A6[\"Google Sheets\"]B1[\"Personal Blog\"]B2[\"Medium\"]C[\"DeviantArt (Writing)\"]D[\"PlantUML\"] PowerPoint --&gt; Osubgraph notes A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 end subgraph publishing B1 B2 end A1 --&gt; OA2 --&gt; OA3 --&gt; OA4 --&gt; OA5 --&gt; OA6 --&gt; OB1 --&gt; OB2 --&gt; OC --&gt; OD --&gt; OOf course, not everything is a perfect replacement, but certainly my knowledge is a lot more centralized and cohesive now.It has somewhat superceded my Bullet Journal, but I still find value there - but the focus is now on freeform drawing, than knowledge collation or task tracking." }, { "title": "Tmux", "url": "/posts/tmux/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "snippets", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Scroll with your mouse!Ctrl+B, :set -g mouse onRename paneC-B :rename-window" }, { "title": "The Value Of Unstructured Thought", "url": "/posts/the-value-of-unstructured-thought/", "categories": "3 Productivity", "tags": "writing, WIP", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "This article is a first draft and needs review + editing. This is not its final incarnationBullet JournalsI recently treated myself to a dotted notebook to use as a ‘Bullet Journal’. It was my girlfriend (now wife) who introduced me to the concept, and while I was skeptical, the book was cheap and the idea intriguing.I’ve always struggled with self-driven routine. I have learnt that I enthusiastically throw myself into going to the gym, keeping a diary, going rock-climbing - but I never keep it up for longer than a few months. I’ve taught myself to not even bother starting, as I can save the expense and the guilt.The concept within a bullet journal has changed all that. No longer am I beholden to the shame of returning to a diary 40 days after my last entry. There will be no blank pages as proof, and the design of the journal is such that the content is transient, all momentary organizations.The flexible ethos of bullet journalling is fantastic - I don’t feel the urge to start a fresh notebook if I want to do some finance calculations, or shopping lists. Instead of doing that and writing only a few days worth before the notebook goes stale - I just stick it after my previous page about a different topic. In the past I’d start subdividing my notebooks (e.g. from the last page forward, from the middle) until sections started clashing into each other.The whole concept emphasizes contribution over procedure. One of the other ‘spreads’ I have is a monthly tracker, and this is mostly my own twist, but instead of logging exactly how much I have done and intensely pushing it, I simply put some arrows that show my improvement/slip. The rate or absolute number of gym visits doesn’t matter, what matters is that I am improving, or stabilizing from before. I’m not out to get personal bests on the weights machine, I’m there to improve myself.The blankness of the journal really allows a great degree of freedom and creativity with the book. I’m sure others find different parts of it useful, but for me that power of all-in pressure-free logging is revolutionary.BloggingWhen I was actively maintaining a blog, I initially was schedule-less. I set it up with a clear vision to not enforce posting regularly, but I still found that I felt guilty if I hadn’t posted in a while. This problem exasperated itself when I decided to try reviewing content. Slowly, my blog was slipping from a hobby into a side job. I had been generously given content to review, free of charge, and I wasn’t repaying them with timeliness. Note, that this expectation was entirely of my own design. Many of my posts were gaining serious tracking, people were starting to expect more quality posts, I couldn’t keep it up forever.This new ‘front-page’ or ‘gallery’ style website gives me some freedom in that the posts are something to display, rather than to consume. I can feel happy leaving my essays for months, or even years without an update. To enhance this, I’ve considered stripping the essays of the date tag. Seeing how long it’s been can be anxiety inducing and harks back to the blogging paradigms.I still maintain one of my blogs from that period. One where I catalogued my coding / project ideas. This catalogue format, or rather a reference for when I am out of ideas, just needs to have some base content to be useful and timing is non-essential. This is the primary reason why it remains. And I want this to be like that, something to refer to as interesting content. No fluff pieces for the sake of continuity, no obligatory reviews or half-hearted pieces. If something is written there, it’s important, at least to me.Un-StructureAs someone I admired once said when quitting his job, “I am a round peg in a company full of square holes”, I am not someone who fits exactly into careful constructed lines. I don’t know that the majority of the population could be. Humans are a natural source of variance. Look at the ongoing issues of race, gender and sexuality - society increasingly moves towards labelling and placement into boxes. Rather than continue towards that unachievable goal of perfect classification, we should embrace the fuzzy logic that we are built on." }, { "title": "Tensorflow Installation", "url": "/posts/tensorflow-installation/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "snippets", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Tensorflow only releases with AVX enabled.To enable, you can use a community release:https://github.com/yaroslavvb/tensorflow-community-wheels/issues/209" }, { "title": "Switch Games", "url": "/posts/switch-games/", "categories": "6 Lists", "tags": "", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": " Degrees of Separation - Co-Op (Ebay) €17 Unravel Two - Co-Op (CeX) 25€ It Takes Two - Co-Op (CeX) 40€ / (Smyths) 35€ Shining Pearl - Pokemon (CeX) 30€ Arceus - Pokemon (CeX) €42 / (Smyths) 45€ Immortals Fenyx Rising - Adventure (Ebay) €14 / (Amazon) 12€ Sea of Solitude - Adventure (CeX) 30€ Untitled Goose Game - Adventure (Cex) 22€ / (Smyths) 25€ Rayman Metroid Dread - FPS (CeX) 40€ Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe - (Amazon) 49€ Hogwarts Legacy - (Amazon) 53€ Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy - Adventure (Smyths) 25€ Crash Bandicoot 4 - (Amazon) 28€ Little Nightmares 1/2 - (Amazon) 40€" }, { "title": "Ssh Config", "url": "/posts/ssh-config/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "snippets", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "ssh-rsa  has been deprecated in more recent versions of OpenSSHAdd: PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes ssh-rsa" }, { "title": "Samba", "url": "/posts/samba/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "snippets", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-connect-to-linux-samba-shares-from-windows-10/" }, { "title": "Ruling Powers Kachst", "url": "/posts/ruling-powers-kachst/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "The dominant race of the Kachst people are pure blooded Orcs — Similar in stature and build to dwarves, and equally intelligent. Some subspecies exist within the land, but most are underdeveloped intellectually and cannot operate outside their individual desires. These other orc breeds, known colloquially as Urkeen are the result of failed interbreeding between species, often resulting in gross overgrowths of muscle, the formation of horns, tusks and other visual horrors from which their infamy stems.The Orcish god Ankur — God of Urkeen, Redemption, RebirthSeveral groups of minor races ally themselves with the Kachst — Goblins and gnomes the most common of these. Only olive-skinned races are generally permitted to do trade and business with the Kachst.It is this common trait that binds the citizens of the Kachst. The belief of racial superiority lies deep in the culture of the rule and has created intensely loyal followers. Despite this undeniable motivational force, the kachst government has no official stance on the matter.For the Kachst people, the topic of skin color is intimately personal and each lends themselves to the furthering of this claim accordingly. Some channel their energies into the local orcish gods or improve the region’s ability to self-sustain without needing to bargain with external countries. For those less subtle in intentions, members who act on their emotions are scant punished for martial incidents outside the region. Internal conflicts are not tolerated however.An overview of the regions the Kachst controlsWhilst Kachst is not traditionally an initiator of conflict, the lands within its domain are heavily fortified. Diplomatic discussions are rare and so are any concessions by the Kachst. This paranoia is born out of historical oppression from almost all other races — often abused for their relationship with the monstrous Urkeen. Eventually pushed from the established civilizations at the time, the orcs began to build their own leadership, evolving instead in dense forests, rocky outcrops and offshore islands.An orc stalks a rain-forest for large gameThe Kachst is led by a council made up of several representative parties — each renown for their prowess in their field. Year by year the council may change to more correctly represent the population. Notably, militant leaders have always represented at least half the council since it’s establishment.Politically, the Kachst’s most prominent rival is the human Riddean rule. Riddean areas are racially diverse internally, but were the original source of orc mistreatment.The last few centuries have seen Riddean control grow — particularly in areas close to the Kachst. Once solely ruled by the orcs, the island of Forlon was rediscovered by Riddean merchants, eager to bring back exotic spices for high reward. Traffic to the island became furious — greedy merchants, would-be-adventurers and even religious pilgrims. The economic rush became so intense that the east side of the island was taken over in all but name. The Kachst people retreated further into the island, returning once again from human greed and cruelty.Tensions are constantly high between the Kachst and other nations, though conflicts rarely arise — they are acutely aware of the cost of war in both population and liberties. However, with current pushes from the Riddean Empire and the increase in goods that are sourced within deeply rainforested regions, conflict of some scale is presumably imminent." }, { "title": "Rabid Plane", "url": "/posts/rabid-plane/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "The Rabid Plane is known mostly as a battleground for rival mages, boasting an intensely potent concentration of omnipresent energy for magic use. It is also known for its eerie beauty from paintings created by those who have been. Despite the widespread fascination of the area, few have travelled far into the plane, and even fewer have ventured more than a few metres from a portal’s gate.The Rabid plane occupies the same space as the Material Plane, but organic life can only exist in one of the planes at once. There are almost no non-native residents due to the incompatibility of material organisms and the growth here — though there are rumours of certain exiles that somehow survive. Most long term travelling parties are decimated from the onset of hunger, thirst and madness.From inside the plane, one can see the Material Plane as if it were filtered by a mystic storm of energy. The smallest of wind whispers are visible as swirls in the air, the light creaking of a branch twists and contorts unnaturally as if some unseen force were controlling it.An artist’s rendition of the eerie window to the Material planeTravellers through this land are typically dangerous ones. The main advantage of travelling through this hostile land is to avoid being tracked in the Material Plane. Anyone with a purpose to move here has a need to be hidden — whether that be political spies, infamous criminals or powerful mages taking advantage of the area’s magical surroundings.Those in the Rabid Plane can attempt to manipulate the Material Plane as if they were there, but reader beware — as the laws of nature do not apply as they do normally — Reaching a luscious red apple from a tree, the skin falls away and stains your hand. The flesh drops onto the floor as if it was a water-skin without its leather.A human noble lady ventures into the Rabid plane to interact with the creaturesDespite what seems like a harsh environment to us, there is some organic life that originates here — though uncommon. Many are of a shape or size that seems infeasible — their forms seem to shift with the surrounding energy, as if they were part of the world itself.Many of the creatures resemble to the ones found on the material plane, but others seem to be unique to the Rabid plane — silver centaurs stalk the land in the shadows, keeping a close eye on any foreign visitors and occasionally leading them astray.The centaur population is small, but established. There are clear ranked systems and lands are distributed between them accordingly. Nothing is known about the highest ranked centaurs, but their influence reaches over the entire plane.Some specialist traders venture into the plane for particular materials. The most prized of these being a centaur’s spear. Only a few of these exist in the material plane, and break easily due to the time spend away from the Rabid plane. It is a lucrative trade, but a perilous one, much like anything in the plane.Portal gates are commonly near civilized locations. Legend mentions that trade with the other world was an integral part of surviving in the early history of the continent, though it is not known with whom this trade took place. Some gates lie in harsher areas not suitable for habitation, like mountain faces or acidic lakes of Anoor. In war time, many efforts have been made to secure these gates, but it is ultimately futile.In recent times, scholars have been collaborating to research the Rabid Plane, bringing some great advances in medical treatment, though many look upon material exported from the region as cursed. Despite this, there are high hopes for other findings that will benefit everyone — even regional leaders are beginning to invest their wealth into the area to find the next tactical advantage before their opponents." }, { "title": "Project Euler Learnings", "url": "/posts/project-euler-learnings/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "writing", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "This article is a continual WIP, where I will add particular things of note when coming up with solutions to the problems.The importance of sample casesSmall optimizations can sometimes break the logic of your code - so rather than waiting for a long run to finish, make sure you run your test cases first so you can fail early and fix it fast.RegexReferring back to a group matched in regex again with \\1 (number corresponding with the captured group) helped detect recurring patternsPartial capture {0,2} Allowed me to factor in recurring patterns that may clip at the end, e.g. 0.123456123456123ApproachesSometimes the ‘ugly’ way is the fastestA lot of the problems use repeated functions, like isPrime, isPandigital.

He wanted to extert all this nervous tension and dread into a huge sprint and get to the Iron Gate as soon a possible. But he knew he needed every ounce of reserve every to make it there by noon. Each footstep he took brought him further away from Mara whom he had left almost defenceless in the woods as the Red Sun was rising, but a little closer to her rescue. He tried to concentrate on that and after several miles, he was finally there.A huge black wall of stone dominated the flatland. Stretching all the way from the distant river to what he knew led to the sea. One tall set of iron gates protected the only entrance into the rest of the continent. It was wide enough to fit four of the largest carts Natyr had ever seen side-by-side and then some. If it was purely for striking effect or some crazed project of the Empire’s, Natyr did not know, but he was used to getting by - though usually under better circumstances.“Trader Natyr of the mountain Kvatt, here on delivery of furs and leather solid armour to the captain of the Gate” Natyr announced loudly at the wall right of the gate where there was usually soldiers stationed. A helmeted head peered out. “I don’t see anything but you out there. Where’s your load?” “I was robbed” Natyr replied, shouting at the distant helmet. “My companion was shot and is dying. Can you spare some men on horseback?”. The helmet withdrew from the window and a few other voices mixed together, too faint for Natyr to make out. Natyr curled his toes, which were sore from walking. Finally, the helmet appeared again. “Sounds awful like a bandit trap to me. Don’t you have anything as assurance?” Natyr sighed and patted his pockets. There was half a chance Helmet’s superiors would be expecting the delivery, but without coming through the gate himself - he wasn’t getting the message past the greedy watchman. Though, he supposed, it could just be caution. “I told you, I was robbed. I have nothing but myself and the shirt on my back. Cage me while you search. I can tell them the landmarks on their way.” The watchman considered this for a time, discussed it with his peers and eventually the responded with a gesture to stand by.As word spread along the wall, the Red Sun grew higher in the sky until it was fully uncloaked from the horizon. Natyr could hear the scuffle of horses being reigned as the Iron Gate opened creakingly with an armed escort to take him in. He held out his hands to be cuffed and was led inside. Two gallant riders strode over to him and listened to his directions. Natyr felt a little comforted by their attentiveness, but when they marched off, he was left in the cage with nothing but his own thoughts." }, { "title": "Part 7 Last Passage", "url": "/posts/part-7-last-passage/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing, wip", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "These are a series of novel chapter drafts. They are a work in progress and the primary goal of the current work is to get the ideas on paper - not nessicarily for them to be well written Natyr, Last PassageWhen Natyr came to, his first instinct was to check on Mara’s wound. She was still unconscious, but her breathing wavered and her skin pale blueish. Somehow, she had managed to free her foot from its boot during the, loosely termed fight. That made things not quite so dire, but the bandits had left them with all but the clothes on their backs. Natyr ripped a long piece of undershirt from beneath his tunic and wrapped it around the wound. Mara twinged with the attention and hissed through her teeth. It wasn’t a good job, but it would hopefully serve better than no covering at all.They needed to move onwards. The Iron Gate was slightly less than a day’s travel, but in this state it was surely two or three. Still, Natyr heaved the large girl onto his back and began to rejoin the road. His head still ached and his stomach was reminding him it was time for breakfast. His gait was pained and crooked and his shoes dragged on the dirt creating scraping marks behind him. After a tough five miles, there was movement on his back. “Mnn..nngh” Mara groaned and slowly opened her eyes. “N.. Natyr?”Natyr took the opportunity to give his legs a break and set her gently aside. “How does it feel?” He asked, indicating at her leg. She grimaced. “It’s.. not bad” she lied. “I don’t think I can walk on it, but, it’s not sapping the rest of me too bad” Natyr’s stomach rumbled, unimpressed it was almost noon and about eighteen hours since he last ate. “Well, we’ve got a long way to go left” He admitted. “If your mind needs distraction from the pain, we could sure do with some sort of plan.” She nodded obediently. “Maybe if you can find a stick, I can walk a bit”. Natyr’s stomach agreed with the idea of foraging and he hoisted Mara up once more, to a less open spot.The trees by the roadside were flourishing under the nurturing light of the green sun. The berries Natyr picked were plump and bursting with juice. He ate a few while he gathered them and his throat rejoiced at each drop. It took a bit longer to find a decent walking stick, the trees grew quickly with thin and spindly branches so they could out-compete the others. A few paces into the cover though, he found a reasonably sized top half of a tree, split from its base from strong winds or done other natural phenomenon. On the way back to Mara, he plucked the slender offshoots from the base, creating her a rough walking stick.Mara had changed the cloth on her foot when he returned. She was impressed with the stick and leveraged herself up by it, refusing Natyr’s help. “No ideas yet” she admitted. “But we’d want to move soon. I see a faint crimson glow on the horizon. I reckon it’s unlikely Veri will move much, we have perhaps a day, but we don’t want any sliver of a Red Night.” A sour expression crossed Natyr’s face. “You’re suggesting we match through the night? On your foot?” She nodded. “That’s exactly what I’m saying.”—The pair contained to march down the featureless road, only stopping briefly when they spotted a particularly bountiful bush or one of them stumbled. By nightfall they had travelled about halfway by Natyr’s estimations. Good progress consisting their state, but it was clear Mara was going to collapse of they continued. It began to rain and Natyr had to call it in.“Right, Mara. I can’t put you through this. I’ll be carrying you on my back again before the morning.” He wiped some wet hair from his face. “And you’ll catch cold too. We’re going to get you some shelter and I’ll move on ahead. I can move faster without you and I’ll bring some soldiers back” Mara looked at him wearily, wanting within herself to object, but she had moved each last pace out of sheer determination and her energy reserves were shot. “Good” Natyr said definitively. “We’ve just got to find somewhere sheltered from this damn rain”. That was easier said than done, an hour of searching proved fruitless and they had to settle for a small overhanging mound. Mara painfully crouched and withdrew a dagger from a wrapping around her good leg. “Full of these are you?” Natyr said surprised, but took it thankfully and spent some time scraping out a bit more room. “G’wan. Try squeeze in there”. Mara eased herself to lie down and shuffled herself in sideways. It was just about enough of she stayed perfectly still, to avoid the brunt of the downpour. Natyr gave her back the knife. Although it was hers, it seemed almost like a parting gift. They didn’t exchange goodbyes, but Mara knew that when his body was no longer visible through the trees, he had left." }, { "title": "Part 6 Ambush", "url": "/posts/part-6-ambush/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing, wip", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "These are a series of novel chapter drafts. They are a work in progress and the primary goal of the current work is to get the ideas on paper - not nessicarily for them to be well written Mara, Last Passage (Road: Harrus -&gt; Iron Gate)Once Natyr and Mara had the wagon loaded, they were off. It was a happy coincidence that Natyrs delivery of armours and furs to the Iron Gate lined up with Mara’s desire to enlist there. Her strength too, made short work of loading and they left the stables and stores quicker than expected.Like Harrus, Last Passage was closer to sea level than the lofty heights of Karkas, but it was difficult terrain all the same. The wagon’s wheels creaked with complaints and every so often Mara would have to jump off and reload a fallen crate that was jostled off.About halfway, Natyr decided to call it. Both were tired and neither calling mattered so much a day’s delay would cause complaint.A few paces further and there was a convenient spot pulled in from the road where they could park. It had clearly been used by other travelers before, based on the worn state of the path, but they reckoned that meant it was tried and tested. From the side of the cart, Natyr pulled a thick sheet of cloth, attached to two poles that would act as a tent. Though it was built for a single person, Natyr and his daughter usually slept close. Mara however, was larger than Ferrin and Natyr felt a definite discomfort suggesting getting so close to his daughter’s friend. The stars were clear above them, so the lack of cloud cover probably meant it would be safe to sleep with their legs exposed. Mata issued no complaint and Natyr wondered silently again if she really had thought this all through, but left the thought unspoken.It was a reasonable sleep, aside from the occasional pantherwolf howl, the bleating of far away sheep or the hooting of unseen birds in the night.Light began to return to the world, through golden beams filtering through the tree leaves and a gentle warming of the surrounding forest. Mara woke first and sleepily wiped her eyes, willing them to focus. As they did, her heart sunk as before her, happily sitting cross-legged outside the camp, was a familiar figure in a leather jacket, holding a loaded crossbow that was casually pointed in her direction.“You’re quite precious when you sleep” The woman smirked. “Wake up your father there princess”. Mara turned to shake Natyr awake, ignoring for now the confused identity. “Nyeh-Gmnf” Netyr muttered and swatted her hand away. She decided to slap him across the cheek and he spasmed into conciousness. “Wh-Woah. What’s going on here?” He pulled himself up into a sitting position, propped up on the cart. “Ah, so it’s you”“Always a pleasure sir” She beamed. “Maybe next time you can play along with my game before I take your stuff, rather than have it drawn out like this” She lazily swapped her target to and fro. “Well, it’s too late now, so if you just kindly leave your wagon and horse there and continue on your way, we’ll not have to meet again” She winked “Unless you want to that is”Natyr sighed and stood up. “Fine, I have some coin, let me keep my livelihood.” She considered his movements and let him walk to take out his purse. Once he had done so, she answered. “Nice of you to offer, but I have a counter-offer - both.” She stifled a laugh. Mara raised herself to her feet, using her sword as a crutch and marched forward angrily “You’ll take nothing!”. With a quick flick, she was at the bolt-end of the crossbow. “I think you misunderstand my gallant princess. Think. Who has the upper hand here?” Mara raised her sword “There’s only one of you, and you have to reload that crossbow to shoot again”. Natyr threw the coin purse at the woman. “Mara, don’t get yourself killed” He warned.“When did I say that?” She faked a confused look and waved a hand in the air, calling two hidden men from the trees, each with their own crossbows. “Put down that toy and just step aside” Mara stood defiantly, sword still raised. “Fine” The woman shrugged and clicked her trigger, sending a bolt into her foot and pinning her in place. Mata shrieked and clutched her leg in agony. “What are you waiting for, hook up the cart and get moving” she ordered. The men shuffled forward. The first man and the stronger of the two, untied the horse from a nearby tree. Clearly not someone ever familiar with the beasts, he subdued it by sheer strength alone, yanking it’s reins so it could do nothing but follow his direction. The other walked around the crippled Mara and over to Natyr. The hulking figure opened his mouth to demand Natyr move aside, but decided a quick fist to the head was a quicker - and more satisfying - way to get what he wanted.Natyr’s vision blurred as he began to slowly slump to the floor. His body gave way beneath him and as darkness eclipsed his eyes, he heard the thud of a similar fate befall his companion." }, { "title": "Part 5 Recruit", "url": "/posts/part-5-recruit/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing, wip", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "These are a series of novel chapter drafts.

It might not have been far, but even threading these few roads of Harrus was something few would do lightly. She had arrived late and the shadows of buildings were beginning to stretch and conceal casual passers-by. Each step on the cold cobblestones sent waves of worry through her entire body. Her stomach was starting to turn.She turned out of an alleyway and into a wider stretch of road lined with tall looming houses on either side. Several of them had smashed in windows or ominous markings scratched into their doors. Her eyes darted around for her contact, but all she could see were other figures in dark cloaks. Was she imagining it, or were they moving in time? as a group? Cold beads of sweat began to form on her brow beneath the fox-fur hood. She looked around at her options and changed course - turning sharply into an open square.She glanced behind her, taking short shallow breaths and noticed two figures turning after her. Her head felt heavy with dread and she began to ran - cursing herself for now making her an obvious target. She was over to the other side of the square almost immediately and turned out again, trying to resume her original course. The muffled slaps of cloth on stones echoed behind her and she couldn’t look back to tell if it was her own, or her pursuers.It wasn’t far now, just a few more streets. Her forge-trained lungs worked hard, but her muscled legs were built for weight, not running and her speed was slowing. A single street away, she propelled herself around the corner, hugging the wall as she reached for the dagger she had stored on her waist under several layers of warmth. Her ragged breath emerged in hot plumes of vapor. Her dagger was out and she waited, trying to stay as still as possible. Moments passed, She could hear the drips of cold water spill off of tiled rooves onto the ground below. She could hear the faint footsteps of other pedestrians. She held her breath to still her pumping heart.Nothing came. Mara released her tight press against the wall. An area of warm droplets was left on the brick where the beginnings of frost had melted. She edged sideways down the empty street, keeping a close eye behind and in-front, with a few glance above too. Eventually, she reached her meeting place - Traitor’s Port.Traitor’s Port was named so as the only two destinations on it were to the island of Ese, or the island of Hered. Hered home to a secluded temple of religious scholars who were self-sufficient despite the harsh ocean weather. As for Ese - simply put, it was where the most hated of men and women went to die. There was some hope in Harrus of escape, there were tales of it - for the soldiers weren’t always diligent in patrols and there were ways to leave if you could somehow stay alive long enough to build a boat. There was nothing on Ese aside from sharp rocks and other exiles - all dead by the time you’d have arrived.(Story hook: someone is still alive)The place would normally be deserted but rumors of troop movement southwards had a few hopeful entrepreneurs building stalls and signs to pry away some military silver. Rumours filled the taverns of various ne’er-do-wells who might be the cause of all this fuss. Some said the Emerald Prince was being disposed of by the Queen in a political move - others said the famous bandit Twentyswords had resurfaced but he was outed by a friend.In any case, there way enough people here to ease Mara’s tension. It was easier to start silent and disappear into a crowd than to escape a alleyway cornering. She looked around and saw her landmark - a statue of a large fish, severely cracked and several times vandalized. Beneath it sat her friend’s father. He sat with his head down, counting numbers in his head.“Natyr!” Mara called as she approached, emerging from the crowd. “It’s me, Mara”(Military Is here on a voyage to explore what lies beyond the South peninsula. Father has done his loop and is waiting here)Natyr looked up. Though it was obscured, it was nice to see a friendly face. He waved a hand for her to walk with her as he explained his situation. “We can’t leave just yet. I’m behind on seven jackets. It’ll be one more night. You can stay with me, the room’s big enough for a bedroll. We’ll head to the border in the morning.” He took a breath “No trouble on the way here?”“Y-yeah” Mara fumbled. Truthfully, it had only been mild scares or catcalls. “Just about”“It’s getting dark, we’d best retire now. Ain’t got anything good to do round here eitherways.” Netyr started directing their walk back to the Twisted Dagger ((NAME?)) “You’ll have to tell me how you ever convinced your mother to let you come to Harrus of all places. I thought I was lenient letting Ferrin flutter about back home”“Well… It wasn’t totally amicable” Mara said shyly, remembering a hefty metal bolt being thrown at her and a deep primal roar from her mother. “But in the end she wanted whatever I wanted, as long as I thought it through. You’ll uh.. give Ferrin my best wishes when you get back?”“You didn’t tell her?” Netyr asked, surprised and Mara gulped. “I couldn’t. You know how she is, it would have made leaving so much harder.” The tavern drew into view and conversation lulled anxiously. “Just follow me and don’t look about” Netyr instructed and Mara promptly nodded.The tavern had cycled its patrons, most of yesterday’s crowd likely cradling their heads in their rooms. A few faces were the same. The bard in the corner stage, the gamblers’ table and the temptress who floated about as usual. Natyr felt her eyes watching him as they made a direct path across the room. He ignored it. Halfway there and Mara let out a small yelp from behind him as the echoes of a slap on the rear filled the air, accompanied by raucous gruff laughter from various drinkers. Mara’s face was flushed scarlet and Natyr hurried her in front of him and gave the woman ((Give her a name)) a deathly stare. She smirked mockingly “Better catch than me it seems?” She guffawed and turned back to throw some dice with the gambler’s table. Swallowing the urge to teach her a lesson, Natyr pushed Mara onwards and locked the bedroom door behind them.“Ignore those brutes. We’ll stay here and have breakfast on the road” Natyr said once they were able to catch a moment to themselves. He offered a deck of cards to play until the night had come a little closer. It was a beautiful set with gilded edges that surely had cost him a fortune. Mara readily accepted and pulled over the room’s small writing desk between them. “So, what convinced you to join the army?” Natyr asked, dealing out the cards.“It’s not the most lavish lifestyle you know”. Mara hummed and threw out a card - six icicles. “I feel born to fight” She began. “I love the forge, I really do - but there’s something within me that itches for a fight. Ever since I first made my sword with mother” Natyr countered the six with a two of flames. “The folks in the army… many of them are no better than the scoudrels here. Just a uniform and orders on top of people who enjoy killing. Ain’t you thought of bodyguarding or something else? That squeal of yours won’t do you any favours in the rank-and-file” She blushed at that, and hid her face as Natyr swept away his winning hand, opening with a three of Wind. “I was just caught off-guard” She insisted. “And there’s no jobs worth doing for anyone who hasn’t had any kind of enlistment.”Natyr nodded as they continued a few more rounds. “Sounds like you’ve got it worked out at least. The town’ll miss you.” He said, thinking of Ferrin. She shrugged silently, obviously tender about that point. “They’ll be okay” He added, flicked through his cards and yawned. “How about some rest then? We’ll have a few days for me to show you how to properly play” He smiled kindly." }, { "title": "Part 4 Silk Trading", "url": "/posts/part-4-silk-trading/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing, wip", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "These are a series of novel chapter drafts.

Ye bollix!” Natyr groaned as his grip on the wooden crate slipped and the box crashed down on the ground, rupturing into shards. He kicked the cart in frustration. Usually he had two pairs of hand for this.But that wasn’t all of it. It had increasingly dawned on Natyr that this was the first time in twenty years he had been alone - and he didn’t like it. The road was quiet and the horses were irritable because of the biting cold.It was nice to enjoy a tavern room all to himself though, and once the crates were finally reorganized, he headed there for the night.The Second Chance tavern was busy and had a welcoming buzz on the air, but Natyr walked through the crowd and straight to his room. Almost no-one from Harrus was there of their own volition. It was the first town on a long peninsula of exile and escape. Kartas was one of only two original settlements and they both suffered from the Riddean Empire’s decision to let criminals freeze to death out here. Did would go missing, and sometimes even people - but that was mostly an issue in the summer months, when the mountains’ sharp trails seemed to soothe as the snow melted away - often revealing several failed winter travellers.Nevertheless, there were still a few who scraped together a living in the town and could be trusted - at least when gold was on the line. Natyr rested easy knowing his horse was well stabled and his door bolts were solid.In the morning, the same patrons were still active, though clearly heading for collapse through either exhaustion or alcohol consumption. Natyr grabbed a stool in an empty corner and ordered a meal of oats and berries.“Mornin’ to ye Natyr. Hitting the road now?” The owner delivered the meal himself. “Might want to take the West road - new shipment of vagrants coming in from the East” Natyr nodded his thanks and focused on his breakfast. The berries were sour and the porridge too cold, but it did the job.The attention of the bartender had alerted others to his presence. A tall woman wearing a padded leather jacket slipped into his stall as the man left with an empty tray. “You seem different than the rest of these louts” She pressed “Very business-like”. Natyr wasn’t in the mood for whatever this woman wanted. “I’m just here to eat my breakfast and leave” He shrugged and spooned a large helping into his mouth to accentuate the point. “Not the type for parties or chattering”. The woman smiled thinly. “Oh dear” she said dramatically. “Perhaps you might be in a better mood if you got rid of some of that tension?” She slid her hand over to his, gently grazing it. His eyebrows ruffled and he looked at his hand. His fingers bore no rings, but on one there was a permanent indent and reminder. “Look lass, I just want to eat my breakfast and leave this place.” He shifted his bowl away from her. “I’m sure there are others here more willing to talk with you than I”.Some thought twinkled in her eye. There were generally only two directions one would leave Harrus and the soldiers maintaining the peninsula’s border to the rest of the continent would not dare to drink amongst locals. The only other way was further in. “Leave? Are you one of those religious types? Off to absolute solitude, away from all the forbidden pleasures of the world?” Each sentence was thick with dramatic mockery. “How very noble, but wouldn’t you like one last taste before the doors are closed off to you forever?” She leaned further in, less subtle now, her chest peering out at him.“Put those away” Natyr coughed on some of his porridge. “I ain’t one of those nuts, I’m just selling cloth and I’ve a daughter as young as you, so clear off and let me enjoy my food. I’m not interested.”Show, don't tellThe woman threw her hands on the table and kicked out the stool from under her with a swift foot. “Sure hon. Maybe you’ll come find me when you’re not busy being up your own arse.” She gave a final theatrical smile, threw a gesture to the bartender for a new drink and moved onto the next solitary character.Natyr sighed and finished the rest of his porridge quickly, having already gathered more attention than he desired. The sooner he was out of this dead-end place, the better.ad-todo make the place sound even more dodgy.

She was the kind of woman who would instill a deep fear into the core of your being without as much as lifting a finger. My father always described her as an iron hand in a velvet glove. I had unfortunately not inherited his ability to talk his way out of these types of situations. Pera threw a pair of brooms at us harshly. “Just get in there and start working! You’re not ready for anything if you’re not ready to show up on time.” We both nodded shyly and skulked into the back of the forge.The work wasn’t so bad. We knew Pera didn’t expect perfection as the forge dropped ash and soot around us almost as fast as we could sweep it. Mara was eventually called off to help with the orders, leaving me to the endless task without any idle chit-chat to break the boredom. Lunchtime wasn’t long, but it was delicious - Mara had bought sweetcakes from the market that morning and they still tasted just as soft and fresh. However, we were constantly reminded between bites that we were only getting them as they would go to waste anyway. Pera, like her daughter, was not ill-meaning but held a grudge.The second half of the day was filled with yet more sweeping, but I got to see all parts of the process. The intense heat to melt the iron, the clanging of metal on metal and the order and delivery front-of-shop.I made a point of being early the next day. Not just for fear of Pera, but because I genuinely wanted to learn. All sins were forgiven that morning as the forge doors opened and Pera was in high-spirits.A large order of horseshoes had come in with a messenger from the Riddean army. Their route was to pass through here and the harsh mountain roads would surely wear out the already long overdue feet of the horses. It wasn’t an easy start, but I was put to work with easier tasks, beginning with puncturing the metal so that each shoe had eight nail holes, precisely located around its circumference. Pera showed me how to do it once and left me to it. About five in, Mara came over and corrected me in my methods - having had to trash my previous work to be re-cast. Soon enough I had the knack of it, though every so often Mara would come over and throw the last few shoes into a bin. Pera seemed happy with the work though, and over the rest of the week I was trusted with more and more of the process, until I could forge my own shoes - though my output was not half the pace of the other two.Over the course of the next few weeks I learned a lot about blacksmithing. Where best to hit and heat the metal, knowing the perfect time to stoke the fire and most significantly, that almost all the work was houseware and farmware. While working on some of the final barrel hoops for The Fallen Knife, a tavern one town over, Pera put down her hammer and walked over to my anvil, wiping her brow with a towel from an ice bucket. “You’ve got what, two weeks until you go to Jer and the butchery? I’ll be honest, with your and Mara’s antics, I didn’t expect much aside from repaying you father a favour. But you’ve actually been a good help. Here.” She tossed something metal at me, which I awkwardly caught with my own towel. I opened my towel and saw a strange metal square attached to a metal sphere which had an opalescent stone set into it. It looked like the top of a bedpost. I rolled it in my hand. It was well made that was for sure.“Mara made it for you” Pera explained, and sensing my confusion elaborated further. “It’s a pommel, for a sword”. The look on my face didn’t change much, so she had to spell it out for me. “You’re going to make yourself a sword Ferrin”. I gasped. Mara had told me several tales of how her mother crafted epic swords for passerby knights or deadly assassin daggers for figures refusing to give names, but after weeks of relatively uninspiring product I had come to understand that the only crafting here was of stories in Mara’s mind. But my own sword! And with such a gorgeous end. “It’s only glass” Pera interrupted my silent marvelling. “It’s quite a good technique isn’t it?” I nodded quietly and continued to roll it satisfyingly in my hands. “Thank you” I managed. “Where is she?” It was strange she wouldn’t give such a gift to me herself. “Said not to tell you, but she’ll be back in a few weeks. The soldiers will be here by then. You should come by to see that work to an end and I’m sure Mara will be delighted time to apply the finishing touches to that new series of yours then too”And so it was, that the next two weeks were filled with both heartache and joy as the sword was cast and recast. The blade was always too heavy, or too fine, bent or curving. Mistakes made at the beginning of the process were only discovered at the end when Pera had time to review it. But, after all that hard work, I finally had something to call my own. It was surely the work of an amateur still, but each of those beaten dents were my own. The weight felt good in my hand. I had worried, like her daughter, Pera was built for forging and other heavy labor, and I feared I would emerge from those two weeks with a veritable claymore I could barely wield. But of course, they were both professionals and the blade was perfectly suited to me and my own stature.Moving to the butchery was difficult. Not least because of the task, but because I missed Pera and my friends. Pak had his own business to run and Mara was mysteriously absent. Even my stubborn refusal to admit to myself that I missed my father was beginning to wane." }, { "title": "Part 2 Friends", "url": "/posts/part-2-friends/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing, wip", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "These are a series of novel chapter drafts.

It was the first time he had left me behind on my own - not that he wanted to, but relented after I stubbornly refused to go, locking myself in my room until he promised to let me stay.I was already sixteen, my friends were in this town and there was nothing on that road for me but dried, salty meat rope and days of monotonous riding. When we did stop, I had the luxurious job of unloading and reloading the crates off and onto the cart, while my father exchanged pleasantries with his clients. This was not how I saw my life laid out before me. I was meant to do something greater with my days than count the peaks we passed by and reckon if there were greater or fewer than the day before. No, the world had something in store for me, something special and particular. I just had to find it.Beginning to understand that fateful destiny was the next six months work for me. My rank in the community, the glint of deep red peeking out from a small hole in my earlobes, made it easy to organise several short stints in the other professions around the village. First on my list was Pera the blacksmith, but before that I wanted to enjoy the freedom I now found myself in, so after the plumes of dust settled on the horizon, I lowered my waving hand and headed for the town hall.The town hall was abuzz with activity. Aside from community events like the annual stone-setting, marriage and death, the oversized domed tent served as the setting for merchant stalls, casual meetings and even smaller sporting activities all at once. Mata and Pak were sitting on the west side of the huge arena, watching two contestants wrestle one another on the dusty floor. The crowd around them flowed back and forth as the match moved to and fro, not constrained by any concept of boundary or separation from normal thoroughfare. My friends however, had secured a cozy viewing spot above a farmer’s stall. Stacked wooden cages of scrawny hens provided an elevated platform for those light enough (and perhaps foolhardy enough) to climb them. The only disadvantage was the noise of the birds - but no-one watched wrestling matches for the sounds.“Up here gorgeous!” *Pak called out above the crowd as I emerged into view. Those in the crowd who recognized me or caught a glimpse of my gem parted to make way for me and soon I was below my friends and beginning to climb myself up beside them. An explosion of loose feathers, dusty plumes of feed and cacophonous squalks heralded my welcome - as well as a disapproving, but resigned glance from the farmer.Pak was the son of the town’s tailor and had laid out reams of fabric for us to sit on. Both dealing in fabric had made our fathers natural friends, but like his father Pak was not. Pak’s father was a broad-shouldered man of traditional and strict qualities, his business thrived on the reliable, impeccable supply of formal suits for the town. As a matter of preference and advertisement, he was always the most smartly dressed in the area. Pak was besotted with fabric itself and often wore drapes of it without any stitching at all. He was slender, beautiful and his rebellious nature made us fast friends.Mata was too engaged in the spectacle to offer much more than a brief wave as she cheered on the match. An amateur wrestler herself, Mata had an ideal physique for the game - stout, strong and hands like a mountain lion. I squeezed myself better the two of them and sat down, legs dangling over the edge. The comforting, but confusing smell of dry feed, Pak’s perfumes and the lingering charcoal scent of Mata’s mother’s forge, relaxed me a little and soon I too was absorbed in the match, enthusiastically cheering on whoever was losing to get back up again.The long bout came to an end with the smaller man immobilizing the other with a crafty feint hiding a nasty-looking headlock. A headlock in which I now found myself in under Mata’s grip. “Yes! It was just like this! And he still had a hand free! Amazing!” Mata enthused above me. I groaned in theatric display as I waited for her to release me. It was truly a great hold - I was at her mercy and my head was turned so that I couldn’t predict her next move. The answer soon came in the form of a hand, no - two hands prodding at my side. Pak had been recruited to my torture and was trying to find a particularly ticklesome spot. I trashed my legs, shaking the unstable tower of crates and threatening a full consider. Mata loosened her grip. Not for fear of hiring me, but the knowledge that being of lower status, only she would get the blame from the farmer should their chicken castle cave in. I breathed in a long unimpeded breath and punched them both playfully. The day went on and we spent it wandering around the building, causing minor mayhem in our wake. We danced beside the musicians in the Northern corner, listened to stories of the titanous gods who lived in the land before us, gathered and spread some baseless rumours and window-shopped with no intention of buying.It was bitter-sweet, as we all knew days like this were coming to an end. Both Mara and Pak would be expected to be full time workers under their parents by the time summer came, and though I didn’t mind it, the elder council looked increasingly disapprovingly at our horseplay - especially when I was prone to playing the defendant. Even the headlock now had been unusual - ever since Mara’s mother had sat her down for a candid conversation about adult life, she had died away from physical contact with me - though she always had been fanatical when it came to wrestling, so I want surprised and neither did I complain.We ended the night in Pak’s house. Despite his personal set of strict codes, his father was supportive of his son’s break from tradition. He was just happy either of his two sons had any interest in his craft. To that end, Pak had been allowed to have a section of the work room to himself. It looked like what I imagined a fortune teller’s tent might look like - elaborate sheets of embroidered fabric hung from the ceiling to create a closed-off sub-tent. Inside were plush cushions, incense burners and a wall floor-to-ceiling with rolls of hand-selected material. If didn’t feel like a shop, though, I suppose I never visited with the intention of buying anything - even if I did occasionally leave with something Pak insisted I simply had to have. It felt like a second home, and with noone to go back to, I expected it really would be for the next six months. We sank into the pillows and chatted until we couldn’t and we sat in comfortable silence for the rest of the night.We woke with the sound of rustling beads - someone had come through the shop door - and by the brightness of the light streaming in, it had been opening time for several hours now. “Homir’s tits!” Pak cursed and started to usher us out as began brushing down his clothes which were still covered in chicken feathers and grain. We stumbled out of the draping cloth and tried our best to look like genuine customers. “Good day to you, what wonderful merchandise you have!” Mara called stildedly and with a swift elbow from me, quickly decided silence was a better tactic.Once we were outside, it took a small while to fully adjust to the bright sky and brisk mountain air. I was still squinting as Mara grabbed my hand and tugged me into a run - It was the first day of my blacksmithing experience and I was already late! I shook my head roughly as if to clear it of sleep and chased the long-haired Mara in front of me Make the departure of the father more impactful." }, { "title": "Part 1 Ferrin", "url": "/posts/part-1-ferrin/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing, wip", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "These are a series of novel chapter drafts. They are a work in progress and the primary goal of the current work is to get the ideas on paper - not nessicarily for them to be well written Lyrei, Kvatt Town Arena - 4th Age Anno 300I winced involuntarily as I heard the infant Ferrin scream. The skin on her left earlobe parted smoothly under the cold steel of the elder’s blade. She was far younger than the other children here, but it was her fifth observation of the cross-moons and that was when everyone had their stones set. Out in the icy wilderness, Ceremony was one of the only remnants of our previous lives we had left, and so it waited on noone.Ferrin’s father was a cloth merchant. He bought and sold fabrics from the wandering traders that happened upon our small village. Usually bought up the lot in one fell swoop — and sold them on for double to anyone who was interested. For her parent’s efforts, Ferrin had the immense honour of having ruby insertions. I could see them glinting deep crimson even from my seat at the very back of the hall. These were the only rubies I had ever seen, bar those rare promotional visits from the royal court. They were mesmerizing, their liquid red so vividly clear despite their size and distance. Her father must have spent half the town’s gold on the pair, only for them to be hidden away inside his child’s ears.Her tired screams faded into the rising murmurs of the audience — obviously, I wasn’t the only one impressed. The twangy voices of the butcher’s girls and the always booming voice of my father floated above the noise of the congregation. Father always spoke without subtlety or attention to volume — he was telling me of his suspicions of the money’s origin, oblivious to the nearby audience who could hear him. He was a kind man, but he never ceased to embarrass me.I looked away as the elder dropped his hand to the hot iron resting in the furnace. Most children fainted by this point, making the ceremony mostly a bearable ordeal — but Ferrin was stubborn-hearted and her scream continued as the foul stink of burnt flesh once again engulfed the room. When I finally looked back, I could see that it was a clean seal — one that, in a few years, would be invisible to the all but the most perceptive.I envied her. Gem-bearers of that grade never need fear poverty or discomfort — despite what their folly and ineptitude might merit. The other ranks of stone were already intimately familiar with me, my copper inserts barred me from all but the lowest of establishments, events and any future prospects. Luckily, my father and the elders were close and it usually went unspoken if I appeared at some of the town events and pushed what was normally acceptable, all provided I didn’t cause any more reason for my exclusion.The next child was brought to the podium, his body visibly tense as he grabbed the guiding hand of his mother. I excused myself from my seat, making room for an elderly couple who had been looking expectantly at my seat since Ferrin’s turn had concluded.Ferrin was the only child I was interested in watching, the other children would receive standard stones— opal, serpentine, jade. I decided to leave before my presence irked the sensibilities of the less accepting town members. With some effort, I managed to open the great hall doors enough to slide through and proceeded outside, greeted coldly by the buffeting wind." }, { "title": "Pacman Haiku", "url": "/posts/pacman-haiku/", "categories": "5 Poetry", "tags": "poetry, haiku", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Yellow chomping ballchase blue pink orange and greenwaka! waka!

Despite the majority of evidence, Elves in this age are unlike the elves depicted in many current documents. The elves themselves are self-elected historians of society. Convenient, considering that they are the only race that is wealthy enough to build the large archives required, the only ones with an interest in academia and the only ones with free time to pursue it. Because of this, bias has crept into existing records and as their relations with other races has worsened, documents have started to reflect their own perceived superiority as a race — and the baseness of others.The elves have forever been self-important, although, not without reason. For they were the race who had first explored the world’s oceans, united the continent for the entire time and, more recently, discovered how individuals can harness portions of the earth’s power.Many elves find the masks inhibiting and have researched alternate ways to access magicMost layfolk refer to this harnessing as magic, but as magic users know — the actual potential for this energy is severely limited, however the mystique of this new technology and the exciting concept of magic has stuck and even the elves themselves refer to it as such. The term magicians however, didn’t take off. Perhaps that is a term more suited to tales of fantasy.Magic users require a specifically designed mask that helps synchronize breathing rhythms with the inherent pulse of the earth. Each mask needs to be hand-crafted for each user, meaning the expensive equipment is, of course, mostly confined to the elves. Any elf worth his salt owns a synchronizing mask, and the more affluent will often have intricate designs on its surface.Recognizing elves is usually a simple task. Similar to humans, they are seldom seen mixing with other races or travelling far from comfortable surrounding. Both their masks and eye-catching ears give themselves away.A rare painting of a stone insertion ceremony. Usually children are at least three years of age, but there is no defined age for the ceremonyElves’ ears have stones inserted into them at an early age as a rite of passage, giving them an elongated appearance. Depending on the position of the elves’ family, different stones will be used. Arrangements ranging from chained rubies to iron substitutes may be seen. Despite being a large ceremony and part of an elf’s life, elves generally deny the claims of the insertion ceremony— instead claiming that the gems grew during childhood and is a natural part of an elf’s life.As of time of writing, the population of elves is dwindling, despite their long lives and opulence. This is due to a culture change, where younger elves have become increasingly self-indulgent and decline to aspire to having a traditional family.

The world is vast — and each year many grow subtly different.The last major evolutionary branch began somewhere between 300OE and 150OE —A catalyst to the escalating tensions of the land and a prelude to the now-shamed caste system.Lower-Class humans’ industrial efforts fueled two centuries of warHumankind was divided. An industrial age had begun and many nations were at war over the varying resources of the continent.Outmatched by other races in both tactical and military might, humanity acted as a neutral producer — providing weapons, food and information to both sides of the ever surfacing battles.This stance fared well for humanity’s global position — Human influence and thought spread into other nations, The human King’s wealth became immeasurable and many from all over owed the humans great favours.What was good for some humans though, was bad for others, and a resentment between ‘those who worked’ and ‘those who sold’ grew continuously.Towards the end of the time period, there were many attempts of uprising, but they were continually repressed by the nobles who hired non-human mercenaries. The class split and intolerance between them meant that several generations did not choose partners outside their ‘tier’, later manifesting in a physical mark of class — Those of higher esteem had much better health and grew tall and slender, while the rest of humankind’s statures stabilised and grew no further. Rugged looks were desirable amongst most of the populace, but in higher circles it was seen as a mark of low birth.The wealth gained during this period allowed for Upper-Class humans to travel, trade and overtake the other races in civilisational progressThe physical separation of humans grew deeper over the years, as each person looked for a mate with their now-altered image of ideals. Now, these humans are so distinct to be known, to the lay-folk, as distinct races. The once “Upper-class humans” kept the racial title of “humans”. “Lower-class” humans became known as Dwarves — because of their height.Tensions culminated in 230NE when the mystery of gnomish gunpowder was discovered by some researchers in Mikh, a university funded by the human Royalty. Upon being ordered to mass produce the material, the dwarves turned on the humans and used it against them. The war lasted 20 years and ended with a elven-written peace treaty signed both the human King Armin and dwarven rebel leader, Harret Greenshaw.This treaty is important not only for its prevention of war, but it is the first official document regarding dwarves as a separate race. Some dwarves resent the name, believing the ‘humans’ should have taken a new racial title — but most are accepting of the changes. It is not clear if there was human influence in this decision, as the elves have a long history of corruption. Their reputation at this stage was not well-known however.These days, relations between Humans and Dwarves are positive, but all dealings have an air of wariness about them. Mixed marriages have slowly become less taboo, although there will always be some people who cannot accept change.Richard Basequin, August 978NE" }, { "title": "Nearby Attractions", "url": "/posts/nearby-attractions/", "categories": "6 Lists", "tags": "", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "NearbyLoughcrew Gardens Paid Flat Walk, Medium Length CaféLoughcrew Cairns Free Steep ShortMullagh Hill Short Free SteepGirley Bog Short / Medium FreeSpire of Llyod Ireland’s only inland lighthouse.

However, as the area is inaccessible to any planar denizens such as ourselves, any knowledge is almost entirely theoretical and its existence is regularly contested.Lightning can be formed by the natural occurrence of miasma or by invoking its powerThe extent of our knowledge about The Mig only comprises of its intense concentrations of miasma. Many believe it is the only thing that exists there — constantly in turmoil from currents forced by the shifting of planes. As it presses against our own plane, the power is often transferred into our own lands.Those talented enough — or rich enough — to be able to manipulate the energy can channel its raw force in what is commonly referred to as magic. Despite fantastical tales of magical novel page-turning and the like miasma “magic” is based on sheer power —delicacy is impossible.The Mig was originally a tale passed down generation by generation, but confirming evidence has only been established in the last 200 years. When two planes connect to form a planar sear (or rift, as it is more commonly known) there is a transfer of energy between planes. Miasma is amongst these energies. It was found that the transfer of planar energy is unequal. the sear increases the total amount of latent energy, though one side may seem to be reduced. This led to the popularization of the traditional theory of an intermediate source of energy. There is great contention between scholars in attempts to artificially induce sears to further research the phenomenon as many fear it may potentially affect the balance of planar energy with unknown consequences.A planar sear bound to a stone archwayAreas with consistently high concentrations of miasma sometimes have permanent sears which attach themselves to the landscapes of both planes. These are known as planar gates and are heavily contested for political, strategic and research advantages. Though the gates may seem permanent, at any moment they may close without warning and never regenerate again. They may also bind themselves to inconvenient locations that may not be usable by full sized humans.Miasma pools often attract creatures of unnatural origin— creatures born by magic’s kindling or developed under its warping influence. Many of these often-malformed creatures cross over to the other realm and die from the shock of a new atmosphere, leaving many mysterious corpses littered around rift entrances and many other mysterious eyes guarding its grounds.With the advent of industrialization, research efforts are expected to accelerate in the coming years, hopefully bringing new information to light about this mostly unknown area." }, { "title": "Marvel", "url": "/posts/marvel/", "categories": "6 Lists", "tags": "", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": " Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) Agent Carter (seasons 1 and 2)* Captain Marvel (2019) Iron Man (2008) Iron Man 2 (2010) The Incredible Hulk (2008)* The Consultant (one-shot on the Thor DVD) A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor’s Hammer Thor (2011) The Avengers (2012) Item 47 Iron Man 3 (2013) All hail the king Agents of Shield (season 1, up to episode 7) * Thor: The Dark World (2013) Can be swapped with the above, they don’t interact Agents of Shield (season 1, up to episode 16) * Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) Agents of Shield (end of season 1) * Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) – no interaction with the rest of the canon so far Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 (2017) – set months after 1 and still no interaction Daredevil (season 1) * Agents of Shield (Season 2, up to episode 10) * Jessica Jones (season 1) * Agents of Shield (Season 2, up to episode 19) * Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Agents of Shield (end of season 2) * Daredevil (Season 2, e1-4) * Luke Cage (season 1, eps 1-4) Daredevil (season 2, eps 5-11) Luke Cage (season 1, eps 5-8) Daredevil (season 2, eps 12-13) Luke Cage (season 1, eps 9-13) Ant-Man (2015) Agents of Shield (season 3, up to episode 19) * Iron Fist (season 1)* Captain America: Civil War (2016) Black Widow (2021) – occurs immediately after Civil war Agents of Shield (end of season 3) * The Defenders (season 1) * Agents of Shield (season 4, e1-6) * Doctor Strange (2016) Black Panther (2018) Agents of SHIELD (season 4, eps 7-8) Agents of SHIELD: Slingshot (season 1, eps 1-6) Agents of SHIELD (season 4, eps 9-22) Agents of Shield (season 4) * Spiderman: Homecoming (2017) Thor: Ragnarök (2017) Inhumans (season 1) * The Punisher (season 1) * Runaways (season 1) * Agents of Shield (season 5, up to episode 10) * Jessica Jones (season 2) * Agents of Shield (season 5, up to episode 18) * Cloak and Dagger (seasons 1 and 2) * Luke Cage (season 2) * Iron Fist (season 2) * Daredevil (season 3) * Runaways (season 2) * The Punisher (season 2) * Jessica Jones (season 3) * Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) Avengers: Infinity War (2018) Ant-Man and the Wasp Credits Scene Agents of Shield (end of season 5) * Agents of Shield (seasons 6 and 7) * Runaways (season 3) * Avengers: Endgame (2019) Black Widow Credits Scene Loki (season 1) What if… (season 1) * WandaVision (season 1) The Falcon and the Winter Soldier (season 1) Spider-man: Far from Home (2019) Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) Eternals Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) Hawkeye Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) Thor: Love and Thunder Black Panther: Wakanda ForeverUnreleased/Unplaced: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 The Marvels Captain America: New World Order Thunderbolts Blade Deadpool 3 Fantastic 4 Avengers: The Kang Dynasty Avengers: Secret Wars Werewolf By Night She-Hulk: Attorney At Law" }, { "title": "Manga Anime Recommendations", "url": "/posts/manga-anime-recommendations/", "categories": "6 Lists", "tags": "", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "My favourite genre is Psychological Thrillers.Recommendations:Authors:Shūzō OshimiBooks:Chihayafuru: A Josei about Competitive Karuta (A traditional card game)Anime:Delicious in Dungeon (“Dungeon Meshi”)" }, { "title": "Library Notes", "url": "/posts/library-notes/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "coding", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "This article is a continual WIP, where I will add particular things of note as I developMakeMake doesn’t export defaulted variables to subshells, only to sub-makesPythonCPPYYAvoid using const char * and prefer std::string(Cppyy cannot determine the owner of memory with const char * . std::string is generally preferrable in all cases according to developers)" }, { "title": "Latex", "url": "/posts/latex/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "snippets", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": " My BibTex file is not being foundMake sure you are setting the style before you import the bibliograph\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\bibliograph{name_of_bib_file_without_extension}" }, { "title": "Kiki", "url": "/posts/kiki/", "categories": "7 RPGs", "tags": "rpg, backstory", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Char Images &amp; InspoBackstoryBeing raised by a medusa is tough. Especially when she’s not your real mom!Kiki (so named by her adoptive mother) is a sassy dhampir with parent issues. She knows little about her blood lineage, despite her father’s petrified corpse decorating her childhood living quarters.Momo, her snake-haired guardian, did not like to talk about it, which meant of course, that it was incredibly important for Kiki to find out all she could. After eroding Momo with questions over many years, she learned a few things, but nothing that would help trace her family back to its roots. She was born to a different mother, of whom she knows nothing about. She was seemingly alive at the time Momo took her under her wing. Momo was attempting to woo her father when a bad fight broke out, leaving him petrified. Kiki was slung across his back for travelling when he was turned to stone, but unaffected by the gaze. A twinge of guilt led Momo to feel a sense of obligation over the baby boy.Asking more was always threading a fine line, for of course there was always a risk her mother would glare at her to cease her pestering once and for all.An impressionable child, Kiki took on many facets of Momo including a insatiable thirst for gossip, but her fascination with space technology and dhampir romance novels never appealed to her. In fact, she hated those books and blamed them, without evidence, of her mother’s petrification of her real father. She did enjoy a good gossip mag though.Kiki left Momo’s care as she grew into an adult, exploring the world on the cushion of her adoptee mother’s horde. She spent a good portion of the money on some magic teaching, another portion on transitioning, and all the rest on partying and carousing.When the money ran out, Kiki didn’t feel like returning home to the dark dank cave filled with stone memories and shunned her mother to continue out on her own, earning some cash on the road. Momo continues to send her messages, but Kiki refused to return. Slowly, the fracture between the two is mending.Tales of the Mark reached her from both her travels and her mother. It seemed too good to be true - easy cash, free food, hot coworkers and opportunities to kick people’s asses for profit. What wasn’t to like? Plus, it seemed like these folk had plenty of skeletons in their closets for airing out.Despite her prickly exterior, Coco longs for a place she can call home in the outside world. Somewhere that feels like a real whole family, and who knows, maybe a hot spouse and a few children (but they are SO hiring a nanny. She’s not dealing with that)DescriptionKiki has light brown skin and almost-white blonde hair. One or two tiny snakes live in there.She is tall at 5’10” and slender, like many dhampir. She’s often got a viol in hand, or strapped to her back. Her true height is a bit smaller, for she is never seen without her high stiletto heels which double as a weapon in case of emergency. Of course, she has a pair of rolled up flats stashed away just in case the terrain calls for it.Kiki likes to wear colours that accent her skin tone or hair, and when dressing up, her makeup is always flawless. She prefers form fitting clothes to loose ones.For an adventurer, she has relatively few visible wounds. She has issues looking people directly in the eye, preferring to play to a faceless crowd, or talk past people.Town EntranceA vicious brawl crashes out of one of the tavern doors into the streets, bringing with it a cacophony of yelling and angry roars. Two men are mercilessly punching the life out of each other whilst others cheer them on.A slender figure emerges behind them with a smirk she can barely contain, so she hides it badly behind her painted fingertips. After watching the entertainment for a short while, she leaves them to pick up the pieces and continues walking down the road.The stranger’s name is Kiki and she’s been in Corvus a week, getting a feel for the place before signing up to join the guild. This morning, she arrives at the bakery - something she’s done each morning since arriving in, and waves over the owner.“So, like, I’m going to the Mark today” Kiki announces, grabbing a cinnamon bun from the display. “Your buns are like, hella tasty, but you have to like, pay for them, or whatever! I totally don’t know how you’re still in business” Before the shop keeper can retort, she continues. “Anyways, I didn’t come to tell you about that, I wanted to tell you that Sandra, the butcher next door, is like, totally dissing your pastries. I was there yesterday and she told me that you cut your flour with sawdust. That’s like, so not cool, Sandra. I can’t believe she’d do that. Especially since I hear she gets her meat on the black market” Seeds of discord planted, Kiki places down a few silver for the freshly cooked bun and takes a big fanged bite of the cinnamon bun, before turning on her tall stillettoed boots and leaving. “Laters!”Eventually, the stranger arrives at the Mark’s gates and scoffs . “Oh my god, it actually exists! The senile old man’s sugardaddy mansion” She readjusts her viol and few small bags on her back, reminding her that she can’t stand outside gloating at it forever. “Let’s see if this place is as good a goldmine for money and fame as they say!”“Hey you!” She calls to a passerby carrying some turnips on their way to the market street. “Open that door for me”. They stop pushing their wheelbarrow and help open the doors. Kiki doesn’t say thank you, just strides in and tosses her junk on the nearest chair, before looking around for whoever runs this sham of a place.At last! Kiki has entered the Mark!Inspiration BoardKiki is a dhampir who drinks bloodBut she also drains their emotions.

A tall elegant, white haired woman ssits on a throneHer mother is the ruler of Castle Rock + her father was her consort.“I don’t think they’re around anymore. Been a while and no one goes that far North anymore” Between the two, they find some information. The Twin Rocks, Castle Rock and Fort Rock were two fortifications, one in Current Vershnila and one in The Lost Kingdoms. They were part of a small governance that settled in the land of the North before the unification of Vershnila as a whole. Both towns made up Moorloom and they were governed by one Beatrix Nightcrest . They were absorbed into Vershnila as the country came as one and the Aundale rule rose to power. During some unknown time Fort Rock at Vershnila was destroyed in a revolt from nearby settlements, the land overran and taken by neighboring cities. With the nation of Vershnila growing with time, the Vershnila path and crossing to Lost Kingdoms was lost during the “Years of Sorrow”. A time where those who crossed into the lost lands would often become ill or become victim to the rise of undead threats. Most information has faded into obscurity with time, there seems to be centuries since any information about it exists. They simply find a couple of things in very old texts. The location of what was Moorloom’s land, and both Rocks, are sketched on an old, antique Vershnilian geographical map from a cartographer’s journal.

Though several areas of the world remain unexplored at the time of writing, its absolute vastness makes this fact indisputable.Exploration efforts currently are focused on lands across seas, for they bring promise of new discovery more readily than the infinite unchanging sands of Guann. Most maps only document the civilised regions, the major Oases and significant landmarks.Some nomads thread the crest of a sand ridgeThere are many worrying tales that come from the wild desert. Tales of horrific creatures, mysterious structures and unknown beasts often come back from the exiled and from decimated nomadic tribes. Official comments have repeatedly blamed the Guaan’s mirages and travellers becoming hallucinogenic. While many reports may be tales as tall as a sailor’s, it would be unwise to assume there is nothing else out there.TerritoriesWithin Guaan there lies several provinces, each controlled by a separate power. Varying treaties across the years have lain these lines, but Guaan has never in written history been at peace. The territorial lines warp constantly. Most maps have common regions of internal dispute attributed to neither country to keep up-to-date for longer.The Northern part of the area is traditionally the arena where most battles are fought, as this is the only region where countries border. Along that Silv-Serret border lies high concentration of oases, which are of significant tactical and economic interest. Over the many years of fighting, motivations have become less about resources and have mostly been continued by the racial tensions passed down from previous generations who fought each other.The Southern borders are more stably defined. Population numbers inhibit much expansion, so conflicts are rare and while matters of ideals may differ — the land is mostly at peace. The most recent conflict to involve these countries was caused by the encroachment of the human empire of Riddea, strongly opposed by a united force of the native inhabitants. After several years of attrition, eventually the humans were given the Eye of Guann, a separate sand island, as a truce offering. The selection of this area an astute political move designed to inhibit the human’s tendency to argue trivialities of borders, moving slowly out seemingly unnoticed.Despite the heat, Nomads wear many layer to defend against the harsh sand-hurling windsOver 100 different nomadic tribes wander the central part of the desert. Able to sustain themselves through clever navigation and inherent resilience. Many feed on lizards and small desert herbs — both of which have intensely strong flavours, but they are generally the only reliable source of sustenance.Over the course of a year, many things will affect the nomads. The warring states grasp for resources, the peak of summer’s heat and the animal population all affect their population. On particularly harsh years, entire tribes have been wiped out.ClimateThe sands in Guaan vary by region. Their colour can range from brilliant salt-like whites and violent reds, the familiar gold, war torn blacks or even dunes of desert glass. Their consistency differs also — when the southern winds blow, a sandstorm will take on the qualities of the sand it raises — a fine silken mist, sharp cutting swings or harsh grating walls. In certain areas that line the coast, odd coloured beaches can be seen — discoloured from ore grains washed ashore.A common theory is that there once was several deserts where the Guaan now lies. After several years of erosion and environmental decay, they slowly crept towards one another, until eventually they encompassed the large expanse they do today.This theory is supported by the occasional discoveries of ruined civilisations under the sands. Many of which contain old farming implements, seed remnants from more fertile lands and remains of more fragile animals.Sandstorms are the main environmental hazard in the Guann, but they are not alone — sinkholes, weak undergrowth and the seldom eruptions of gas from the earth often take lives of anyone not fully concentrating on their path.The central part of the desert is both the hottest and most inhospitable area of the desert. There have been no successful journeys through the area, so most knowledge is conjecture based on the little we have seen.In the harsher months, animal inhabitants will venture towards civilised areas in their desperation for food. Recently the threat of these attacks have been almost removed due to advances in city guard armouries.CommentCompared to many regions across the continent, the cities of Guann are wealthy — benefiting hugely from trade from one side to the other. This advantage is at risk however, as human influence increases on both sides, they will inevitably want to control the connecting paths also.Guann has a rich selection of cultures, but this too is changing as globally cities expand exponentially. Demand for certain goods such as silk and spice is beginning to overwhelm maximum possible production. Many similarities can be drawn to the early rush for steel, where once it was produced in a simple bloomery, now produced in systems twenty times its size and manned by several men. It may be an inevitability that these trades too may vanish in the coming years.However, even if the large desert cities retreat and the capitals’ money runs dry, the nomadic tribes will still persevere, ever wandering as they always have." }, { "title": "Forgotten Realms", "url": "/posts/forgotten-realms/", "categories": "6 Lists", "tags": "catalogue, books", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Adventures5E Out of the Abyss (1485 DR or later) Hoard of the Dragon Queen (1489 DR) Rise of Tiamat (1489 DR) Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden (Winter, 1489 DR) Storm King’s Thunder (1490 or 1491 DR) Lost Mine of Phandelver (1491 DR) Princes of the Apocalypse (1491 DR) Curse of Strahd (1491 DR) Tomb of Annihilation (1490 or 1491 DR) Waterdeep: Dragon Heist (1492 DR) Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage (1492 DR) Dragons of Icespire Peak (1492 DR) Candlekeep Mysteries (1492 DR) Descent Into Avernus (1494 DR) Acquisitions Incorporated (1496 DR)FaerunDrizztDark Elf Homeland (Comic available) Exile (Comic available) Sojourn (Comic available)Icewind Dale Crystal Shard (Comic available) Streams of Silver (Comic available) Halfling’s Gem (Comic available)Stone of Tymora Stowaway Shadowmask Sentinels Series Book Owned Comic Available Finished Cleric Quintet Canticle       Cleric Quintet Sylvan Shadows       Cleric Quintet Night Masks       Cleric Quintet Fallen Fortress       Cleric Quintet Chaos Curse       Legacy of the Drow Legacy Y Y   Legacy of the Drow Starless Nights Y     Legacy of the Drow Siege of Darkness Y     Legacy of the Drow Passage to Dawn Y     Paths of Darkness Silent Blade Y     Paths of Darkness Spine of the World Y     Paths of Darkness Sea of Swords Y     Sellswords Servant of the Shard Y     Sellswords Promise of the Witch-King       Sellswords Road of the Patriarch       Hunter’s Blades Thousand Orcs Y     Hunter’s Blades Lone Drow Y     Hunter’s Blades Two Swords       Transitions Orc King       Transitions Pirate King       Transitions Ghost King       Neverwinter Saga Gauntlgrym Y     Neverwinter Saga Neverwinter       Neverwinter Saga Charon’s Claw       Neverwinter Saga The Last Threshold       Neverwinter Saga The Companions, Book 1 of the Sundering       Companions Codex Night of the Hunter Y     Companions Codex Rise of the King Y     Companions Codex Vengance of the Iron Dwarf Y     Homecoming Archmage       Homecoming Maestro       Homecoming Hero Y     None One-Eyed Jax       None The Collected Stories of the Legend of Drizzt Y     None Legend of Drizzt: Neverwinter Tales   Y   None Cutter   Y (Owned)   “The Last Threshold” and “The Companions” run concurrently to each other.

Another child - born on the same night in a different tribe.The Clan of the Twinkling Mountain - so called for the high-altitude mirages that lead those unknown with the area to their deaths - was located far south of the continent. A nomadic clan of tabaxi who roamed up and down the range in search of food, materials, and lost artifacts in snow-buried ruins.Whilst out hunting, Fire in the Distance came across a jet black raven - a rare sight in white snow of the mountains. A quick arrow pierced it cleanly and the beast lay dead.Whilst cleaning the kill and placing it in his bag, a haggard old woman - too scrawny and misshapen to reasonably survive in these conditions - peered out from beneath a snowy mound, spat a string of foul hexes at the tabaxi before her anger turned into madness and she fled, cackling maniacally down the mountain.Over the next few days, Fire in the Distance noted a disturbing change in his environment. Since killing that sole raven, more and more birds crossed his path. Unnaturally so. The hunter-ranger tried to pick some of them off, but they were just as agile as his arrows swift. And still the birds came. By the time the mountain cat had returned to his encampment, he was a veritable murmuration.For a while, Fire in the Distance tried to live with their predicament. He became familiar with the birds’ movements - able to shoot his bow behind their fluttering, learning soothing sounds to quieten the birds and stay hidden during a hunt - but back in the clan, Fire in the Distance couldn’t adapt. As much as he learned to control the aspects of his curse, the tornado of birds were simply not suited for tent living nor close relations.Fire in the Distance left the clan then, rather than impose further anguish on his fellow clan members. Wherever he went, Fire in the Distance found a similar difficulty to fit in. Inns would not take birds, even when they were quiet, the prospect of cleaning up all that poop was not promising - at least, not for a standard fare.So, Fire in the Distance was often sleeping rough. Graveyards being a particular favourite for they were seldom visited at night, peaceful and quiet.That is when they came upon Haidon Jorora, who was exploring. After some pleasant conversation, Haidon introduced Fire in the Distance to the adventuring life and they followed a local lead on work - a necromancer in the nearby mountains. Fire in the Distance helped track the way and Haidon lead the charge.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fire in the Distance hopes to one day remove their curse - or at least be able to suppress it enough to reintegrate into society. They would like to return to their clan - or even - start a new one.TraitsPersonality TraitsI have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.IdealsChange.

Within this was the clan Fire grew up with. Fire had parents, sure, but the children there were taken care of by all the adults so he had much less attachment to them than a urban dweller might.Some of the more notable clan members included: Mist in the Morning - A very old tabaxi, who rarely left the tents, except for the migration season Paint on a Rock - A tabaxi bard, who was always very fun Hare in a Trap - The lead hunter who often lead the giant hunts Carriage on the Road - One of the more learned tabaxi, who interacts with traders and travellers oftenAs they mostly hunted small animals, or foraged in the wake of giants, the tribe’s hunting equipment is mostly typical of hunters: spears, bows, traps. But they do have several traps and weapons at their camp in case of intrusion.The tribe moves location on no fixed schedule, only when a location has run dry of resources or there is a particular calling to another place (e.g. intercepting a trade caravan).The giants would possess many fine treasures, from some unknown place, which would sell well - and so stealing? reclaiming these from them, while dangerous, was lucrative.

You can change the random variant to increase the choppiness/smoothness of the resultant graph. The more points in the grid, the better this looks. Take this high-N example from playful.js for example:![[3d_Heatmap_3-1.png]]Setting the sea level in your render is a matter of picking a Y-level and wherever there isn’t any rock below this point, fill the area with water.

With the (relatively) low correctness, I think better results may be gathered if spam alerts were labelled at say 75% confidence and above.My next step is to get more meta information involved in the training. Using the Github API I intend to gather details like the numbers of lines changed and perhaps also whether the contributor also owns the repository.One potential issue stopping us from achieving high rates of accuracy is that classifying a PR as spam is not always clear-cut - and there are many items in the dataset that are either falsely labelled spam or slipped through the gaps.

So I thought to try some image manipulation to try and extract some more information![[Crest - Nearby Grave.png]]Image OperationFirst, I skewed the images so that they were properly squared. Then, the lines still being difficult to read, I applied a threshold to the image, which enhanced the contrast between valleys and hills in the image.There’s probably a good few more techniques I could have applied, but sometimes the simplest is enough. I sketched over the image in GIMP as best I could.Similar Operations were performed on the other grave:Skewing:![[Crest - Similar.png]]Sketchover:I knew these familes were connected and thus thought that gaps in one could be filled by the other and vice versa. I matched up common features and found that most true. There were some small differences - In one image the sword is more curved like a scimitar than straight like a traditional shortsword. In addition the stripes numbered 7 in one image and 10 in the other.Overall, this matches pretty closely with the general stratford crest (Lion Variation)![[G.H.S._Arms.gif]]There is some sign of the arm being cuffed in the second grave, but it is too hard to tell to confirm. Also the head of the lion is too worn to confirm if it is langued. The arm is Detexer (i.e. Right-Side)Color of the stripes would help determine which branch of the Stratford family this is, as it appears to represent the amount of baronies/lands ruled by the Stratfords. In correlating this with other know crests, it might be likely that my Stratfords are descendant from the Irish Stratfords originally from the House of Warwickshire - Though not the Arlbourough branch, which were the more noteworthy.See Also https://www.genuki.org.uk/big/Colin/Misc/Stratfords/Stratfords02.html" }, { "title": "Cosmology", "url": "/posts/cosmology/", "categories": "4 Worldbuilding", "tags": "writing", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "This is a WIP worldbuilding post. The cosmology of the Seven Suns universe is subject to changeLand of the Seven SunsThe world is surrounded by seven solar stars, each shining a different colour of light down on the inhabitants. These have been of great interest to researchers over many millennia.Living in a world with Seven Suns is a harsh existence. Their astronomy is complex and seasons, weather and the wilderness is extremely unpredictable for all but the scholars in big cities.The SunsThe following is an overview of the Suns themselves. They are detailed further in their own chapters.RhumeriaThe Red Sun. Rhumeria is the most distant star in the system. It lies directly above the poles of the planet. As such, it tends to be a constant presence in the sky for some residents of the Northern Hemisphere - both at night and day.The star is seen both as a nuisance and a comfort. Deadly creatures have adapted to the low-light the star emits and are a constant threat. However, the star has been known to disappear occasionally - and this is always treated as an ill omen.Night crawlers eyes are usually well adapted to this light. It is often associated with sexualityCandidius &amp; NigiriumCandidius &amp; Nigirium, the White and Black Suns are often thought of as exact opposites, but that is not the case. While they do tend to cover different halves of the planet in their light, Nigirium’s stellar position moves faster than Candidius’s - meaning that occasionally the Black Star will catch up and eventually overtake the White Star in the sky, moving from a day-night cycle to both being visible in the day time.Candidius is a very harsh, bright star and is colloqiually known as the Sun of Long Shadows. As well as light, this sun provides heat to the world, but standing directly in it is harsh on the skin, so many people stay indoors.Nigirium’s light is black, which illuminates both flora and fauna containing Phosphorus. Military/Police Organizations often use this light to assist in the pursuit of criminals and hunters often use it to track prey.AureusThe Gold Sun. Also known as the Joyous Sun, for it is the only sun whose appearance does not signal a danger to everyday life. Much like the earth’s sun, this sun promotes growth, provides a reasonable heat and is often worshiped by clerics and followers of Life-themed gods and goddesses.CaerusCaerus is the Blue Sun and the largest of all the suns. Occasionally referred to as “The Giant”, Caerus is not as strong an effect on the world as its size might imply.Dark blue shades make it difficult for distinguishing features, rending many animals, creatures and structures invisible. As can be expected, the sole presence of the Blue Sun can signal a heightened risk of criminal activity.The Blue Sun has a uneven pattern in the sky, it is present often - but only really affects the land when it is closer in its orbit (and larger to viewers).RosiatThe Pink Sun. A small sun, but larger than its red cousin Rhumeria. It is also a significantly less harsh presence.Its soft healing light is thought to be good for the skin and its appearance is often paired with celebrations of forgiveness, love and happiness.Rosiat has a similar pattern in the sky to Caerus, but because of its size is commonly interrupted by other solar objects. This can cause Rosiat to disappear from the sky for a few days, or change its hue. Many an amateur navigator has been fooled by its appearance for another star.ViriViri is an average sized, Green sun. Often known as the Solid Sun, for many creatures’ reactions to its light. Plants in areas where Viri dominantly shines grow red and black. These plants tend to have hard pods or shells and similarly, animal populations tend to be different in these areas.Image neededGeneral CalendarThis section is to be overhauled.A week consists of: llong - Late Long Day Sasc - Sun Ascending* Swax - Sun Waxing* Mday - Middle Day* Swan - Sun Waning* Sdesc - Sun Descending* elong - Early Long Day*Months consist of 7 weeks where the suns go through a full cycle.1234321234543234565434567654567176567121767123217There are 7 Months with unique eventsThe Light.

Most of his work consisted of translating other text into Grung so other could more easily understand it.* After some time translating froggie bedtime stories, Bop decided he was meant for more and went out to explore something exciting! Giants! It was very scary, but he gathered lots of important information and returned back to the tribe overladen with sheets of paper. Unfortunately, Bop had neglected to notice the giant stealthily following him and when he went inside his wee froggie house to catalogue his notes, he started hear crunching outside. The villagers were being squashed! After a pitiful fight back, Bop was almost alone in survival. This was no home for them anymore. They grabbed a few of their friends’ skulls and tied them to their staff, a reminder of their past, before leaving the village, ready to seek knowledge on how to bring them all back." }, { "title": "Bash", "url": "/posts/bash/", "categories": "", "tags": "technical", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Types of access$EXPR # Variable Access${EXPR} # Escaped Expansion$(EXPR) # Function Expansion$((EXPR)) # Arithmethic ExpansionGetting the largest filencdu (ncurses du) is really nice.use -L to ignore symlinks and –exclude to exclude folders (such as .snapshot for nfs)" }, { "title": "Avrae Aliasing Tips", "url": "/posts/avrae-aliasing-tips/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "avrae", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Argument Parsinga = argparse(&amp;ARGS&amp;)Grab arguments after arguments with a.last(‘name’) or whatever your variable is called.a = argparse(&amp;ARGS&amp;).last()Grabs only the last entry of that argumenta = argparse(&amp;ARGS&amp;).get('t')Grab all the targets and put them in a listMaps" }, { "title": "Alembic", "url": "/posts/alembic/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "snippets", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "" }, { "title": "14 Nov 23", "url": "/posts/14-nov-23/", "categories": "", "tags": "daily_note", "date": "2025-10-31 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Nov-14-23TO-DOsWorkMeetingsBacklogSee: [[November 23 - Work Backlog]]PersonalSee: [[November 23 - Personal Backlog]]NotesWorkPersonalWIP Handover document - Handover Document.docx" }, { "title": "Aws Reactive Startups", "url": "/posts/aws-reactive-startups/", "categories": "1 technical", "tags": "writing", "date": "2018-12-09 00:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Reactive Startup for Jenkins on AWSMotiveAWS machines are deceptively expensive. Included below are a list of general use machine prices on Amazon’s storefront. 50 cent for one hour doesn’t seem so bad - but what if you have it up 24/7 ? The costs accrue quickly and one server could set you back $416 with only a month’s use.Imagine a large-scale business. It uses AWS machines throughout many places in the deployment to Live process - Service Testing, Integration Testing, Pre-Production, etc. Along with this we have several teams, each with their own requirements - may that be load testing, distributed deployment or something else. A business like such will require many machines with varying costs.First in line to cut costs is to only allocate machines to those that really need them, and to use the sizes they need - You don’t need a heavy duty box to run some lightweight database tests. To further enhance cost reduction, you can also set up dynamic starting/stopping of your machines.OperationA development server runs Jenkins and runs through a set of build and testing scripts every time a push to version control happens. This setup might be a simple single-machines setup, or it may involve several machines, with similar or different purposes.First, the main Jenkins process and the agent processes must be configured to restart on startup. This should ideally be done regardless of whether you continue with this method or not in order to recover your Jenkins instance faster after reboot. This will involve a fairly easy process with Windows through the built-in Task Scheduler or by adding some scripts within /etc/init.d/ on Gnu/Linux.You may need to configure other processes/services for startup depending on your setup. Now the servers are prepared for accidental shutdowns. Or purposeful ones, which is what the next step entails.![[On-Off.png]]We set up two Jenkins jobs: One to monitor for activity, another to monitor for inactivity. Every 20 minutes or so, we check if there are any jobs currently running with Jenkins, and if there are any jobs run in the last hour. If not, we shutdown the agent machines using the AWS Powershell Tools (a simple call like Stop-EC2Instance machine.domain.com ). After a while without any jobs running, the machine will shutdown Similarly the other job checks every 4 minutes for pending jobs, as any jobs triggered while no machines are available will stall until they can execute. Jobs are triggered on Jenkins. At the next check, machines are made available and the jobs can progress We check the jobs’ statuses through our Jenkin’s Remote Access API through a small Python script.ResultOf course, starting machines before a job run will increase the runtime for that job, but this process only adds about 2 or so minutes to the process. After this initial slowdown, machines are active for the next hour or longer, assuming that the successive jobs will be temporarily located. There is a caveat to be careful of when using the AWS Tools - if you boot twice within the hour, it counts as two hours of usage. This is why 1 hour is the recommended back-off time. If we activated this for only non-peak times, we have reduced usage by 66%, essentially reducing a machine like the one mentioned in the intro paragraph from $416 to $138. I imagine this could be reduced to under the $100 mark, but depending on the setup and the amount of activity on your Jenkins this will be more varied month on month." } ]
